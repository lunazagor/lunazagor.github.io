	<h1> J. Luna Zagorac </h1>
	<p> I am a fifth year Ph.D. Candidate in Physics at Yale University primarily working on theoretical particle cosmology and HPC simulations of dark matter. I am co-advised by <a href="https://physics.yale.edu/people/nikhil-padmanabhan">Nikhil Padmanabhan</a> at Yale and <a href="https://www.physics.auckland.ac.nz/people/reas725">Richard Easther</a> at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. I am also a Future Investigator in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (<a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=753338/solicitationId=%7BE16CD59F-29DD-06C0-8971-CE1A9C252FD4%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/FINESST%20ASTRO20%20Proposal%20Selections.pdf">FINESST</a>), which will fund my graudate thesis on simulations and observational signatures of ultralight (or fuzzzy) dark matter. As someone who started coding on lined pieces of paper in Pascal in high school, this is a big deal for me. <a href="/about"> Read more about me.</a></p>
