<h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:optima;margin-bottom:0.0em"> Hello, World! </h1>

<p style="text-align:left;font-size:22px; display: inline"> I like learning languages—modern, ancient, and computer alike. The love of modern languages was seeded early by growing up bilingual; plus, I quickly figured out that I could read more books if I spoke more languages. The love of ancient languages came about somewhat naturally from a love of history. The love of computer languages came from learning to code in Pascal on lined notebook paper in 11th grade. </p>
