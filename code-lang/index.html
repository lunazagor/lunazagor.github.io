<p style="text-align:left;font-size:22px; display: inline"> I like learning languages—modern, ancient, and computer alike.<p>	

<p style="text-align:left;font-size:22px; display: inline"> The love of modern languages was seeded early by growing up bilingual; plus, I quickly figured out that I could read more books if I spoke more languages. These days, I try keeping it up by fighting with the Duolingo owl and try to make my scicomm <a href="https://astrobites.org/2020/09/26/astrobites-goes-multi-lingual/">more linguistically accessible</a> to people back home. <p>	

<p style="text-align:left;font-size:22px; display: inline">  The love of ancient languages came about naturally from a love of history and, to a lesser extent, a love of puzzles and patterns. These days, it's helpful for understanding Easter eggs in Assassin's Creed: Origins and studying Egyptian archaeoastronomy. <p>	

<p style="text-align:left;font-size:22px; display: inline">  The love of computer languages came from learning to code in Pascal on lined notebook paper in 11th grade. These days, I'm teaching myself HTML and CSS (as you might be able to glean from my website!) and using <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/">Chapel</a> on supercomputers to make my code faster. <p>
