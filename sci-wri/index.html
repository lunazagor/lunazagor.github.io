<p style="text-align:left;font-size:22px; display: inline"> My first introduction to outreach was through working at the <a href="https://www.colgate.edu/about/campus-facilities/ho-tung-visualization-laboratory">Ho Tung VisLab</a> and hosting Open Houses at <a href="http://observatory.colgate.edu/">Foggy Bottom Observatory</a> at my alma mater. After starting graduate school, I quickly became involved with <a href="https://gsi.yale.edu/">Girls' Science Investigations</a> through <a href="https://onha.yale.edu/pathways-science">Yale Pathways to Science</a>, where I have made cardboard telescopes, toy rockets, oobleck, and a lot of noise with middle school girls from the greater New Haven area over the years. </p>

<p style="text-align:left;font-size:22px"> Once I began to realize that there was such a field as science communications, I became increasingly interested in the storytelling aspect of scientific research. I participated in my school's 3 Minute Thesis competition, making it to the finals with my presentation on my primordial black hole research, <a href="https://ocs.yale.edu/videos/3-minute-thesis-competition-2019-finalist-luna-zagorac-how-small-black-holes-teach-us-about-the-big-bang/">“How Small Black Holes Teach Us About the Big Bang”</a>, as well as the New Haven Astronomy on Tap where I spoke on the topic of "Cosmic Archaeology: Or, How Do We Know the Things That we Know?". Inspired to further develop my storytelling and communication skills, I attended <a href="https://comscicon.com/comscicon-aip-2019">ComSciCon-AIP</a> at the American Institute of Physics in 2019, and subsequently trained as an <a href="https://aas.org/education/aas-astronomy-ambassadors-program">Astronomy Ambassador</a> at the 235th Meeting of the American Astronomical Society. As an AAS Ambassador I have been a tester for the <a href="https://astrosociety.org/education-outreach/higher-education-and-early-professionals/higher-education-and-early-professionals.html">“On-The-Spot Feeback”</a> project, most recently presenting a re-vamped version of "Cosmic Archaeology" at the <a href="https://www.bayareasciencefestival2020.org/">Bay Area Science Festival</a> in October 2020. </p>

<p style="text-align:left;font-size:22px"> One of my favorite extracurriculars that I've taken up in grad school has been writing for <a href="https://astrobites.org/author/lzagorac/">Astrobites</a>, where I summarize interesting astronomy papers at a level accessible to upper-level undergraduates. I've also gotten the opportunity to interview plenary speakers at the American Astronomical Society Annual Meetings, live-blog talks, and <a href="https://astrobites.org/?s=aas+236">summarize sessions</a> for posterity, and get to participate in a wonderful community of fellow astronomers. I love the process of writing (particulalry when I get to do it in my <a href="https://astrobites.org/2020/09/26/astrobites-goes-multi-lingual/">native language</a>!), and am always looking for more opportunities for science writing.</p>
