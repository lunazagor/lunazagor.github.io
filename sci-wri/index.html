<p style="text-align:left;font-size:18px"> Once I began to realize that there was such a field as science communications, I became increasingly interested in the storytelling aspect of scientific research. I participated in my school's 3 Minute Thesis competition, making it to the finals with my presentation on my primordial black hole research, <a href="https://ocs.yale.edu/videos/3-minute-thesis-competition-2019-finalist-luna-zagorac-how-small-black-holes-teach-us-about-the-big-bang/">“How Small Black Holes Teach Us About the Big Bang”</a>, as well as the New Haven Astronomy on Tap where I spoke on the topic of "Cosmic Archaeology: Or, How Do We Know the Things That we Know?". Inspired to further develop my storytelling and communication skills, I attended <a href="https://comscicon.com/comscicon-aip-2019">ComSciCon-AIP</a> at the American Institute of Physics in 2019, and subsequently trained as an <a href="https://aas.org/education/aas-astronomy-ambassadors-program">Astronomy Ambassador</a> at the 235th Meeting of the American Astronomical Society. As an AAS Ambassador I have been a tester for the <a href="https://astrosociety.org/education-outreach/higher-education-and-early-professionals/higher-education-and-early-professionals.html">“On-The-Spot Feeback”</a> project, most recently presenting a re-vamped version of "Cosmic Archaeology" at the <a href="https://www.bayareasciencefestival2020.org/">Bay Area Science Festival</a> in October 2020. </p>
